# Task 1: 3D Printing 

### Overview

Brief description of the 3D printing task and its goals.

### Materials Needed

List of materials required for the task:

- 3D printer
- Filament 
- 3D model files

### Execution
The first step involves preparing the 3D model, ensuring its compatibility with the chosen filament and printer specifications. Subsequently, slicing software such as Creality or Ultimaker is used to generate the STL file, with adjustments made to print settings for optimal results.

After loading the filament into the 3D printer and performing necessary calibrations, the printing process begins. Throughout this phase, it's crucial to monitor the print and address any issues that may arise.

Post-processing includes tasks such as removing supports and refining the printed object to achieve the desired quality. A final quality check ensures the success of the project.

### What is Perf board?
A perf board, short for perforated board, is a type of circuit board with a grid of holes for soldering electronic components without need of PCB for small projects.
### Various other components

**Solder**: Solder is a fusible metal alloy used to join together two or more metal components by melting it and allowing it to solidify, creating an electrical and mechanical bond.

**Soldering Iron**: A soldering iron is a tool with a heated metal tip used for melting solder and applying it to the joints of electronic components to create electrical connections.

**Soldering Wick**: Soldering wick, also known as desoldering braid, is a fine copper wire braided together, designed to absorb and remove excess solder during desoldering operations.

**Flux**: Flux is a chemical substance applied to surfaces before soldering to improve the wetting ability of the solder, enhance the bond between the solder and the metal, and prevent oxidation during the soldering process.

# Task 13 : 555 Astable Multivibrator 
### What is a Multivibrator?
A multivibrator in electronics is a circuit that produces continuous square wave or pulse wave output, commonly used for generating clock signals and timekeeping in digital circuits.
### Why use Astable Multivibrator?
* They inherently produce a continuous square wave output with no stable states. 
* This characteristic allows for easy adjustment of the duty cycle by altering the values of the associated resistors and capacitors, offering flexibility in generating diverse pulse widths compared to stable or multistable multivibrators.
### Why it is called 555?
Because of its three 5 kΩ resistors that were originally used in its internal voltage divider network.
### 60% Duty Cycle meaning
* A 60% duty cycle means that the device is active and consuming power for 60% of the total operational time, while it remains inactive (not consuming power) for the remaining 40%. 
* This ratio is often relevant in the context of pulse-width modulation (PWM) signals, where the duty cycle determines the average power delivered to a load.

### What is an Oscilloscope?
An oscilloscope is an electronic test instrument that graphically displays electrical signals in real-time, showing voltage variations over time on a graphical screen
